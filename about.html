    <!-- Origin Story -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Our Origin</h2>
      <p>
        The Soosaiya Peter Educational Trust was not founded with walls, but with wisdom. It began as a whisper in the heart — that education is not merely about learning facts, but about nurturing souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey started in humble silence, rooted in rural soil, where dreams dared to grow despite the odds. What began with a handful of students and a blackboard is now a constellation of institutions — each echoing our belief: education with a mother's care.
      </p>

    <!-- Legacy & Culture -->

      <h2 class="section-title">Legacy & Culture</h2>
      <p>
        For us, learning is not confined to classrooms. It lives in discipline, empathy, inquiry, and resilience. We believe in holistic growth — of intellect, heart, and community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our institutions carry forward this ethos — with modern pedagogy grounded in age-old values. We blend the rigor of science with the rhythm of service.

    <!-- Founder's Message -->
<section>
  <h2 class="section-title">From the Founder’s Desk</h2>
  <p>
    When I laid the first stone of what would one day become the Soosaiya Peter Educational Trust, I wasn’t building a school — I was planting a seed. A seed of belief. A belief that education is the most powerful tool we can offer a child, not just to make a living, but to build a life filled with meaning, dignity, and compassion.
  </p>

  <p>
    I came from modest beginnings — I know what it is to walk miles for knowledge, to sit under trees and dream of classrooms. I made a promise then: that if I ever found the means, I would ensure no child would ever have to beg for an opportunity to learn.
  </p>

  <p>
    This trust is not a monument of wealth or prestige. It is a reflection of faith — in children, in teachers, in the slow but certain power of perseverance. We did not begin with grandeur; we began with grit. One building. One teacher. A few benches. And an unwavering spirit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, as our institutions grow and echo with the voices of hundreds of students, my heart remains with that first child who walked through our gates, shy-eyed but full of hope. It is for that child, and all those who followed, that we continue to grow — with care, with conviction, and with the courage to always keep our roots in the soil of service.
  </p>

  <p>
    To the parents who entrust us, to the faculty who stand with us, and to the students who inspire us — I offer my deepest gratitude. May this trust never forget its purpose: to nurture, to guide, and to lift.
  </p>
